            <h3>History of the Chiefs</h3>
            <p>The teams roots are in Dallas. They were known as the Dallas Texans from 1960-1962 and they were part of the AFL. The teams owner and the founder of the AFL later known as the AFC is Lamar hunt. In 1963 He decided to move the team to Kansas City and change the name to the Chiefs after the mayor of Kansas City who was often called Chief. Over the years the team has became tied in and more connected to the Native Americans although the name "Chiefs" does not come from them. The KC Chiefs work to honor the Native Americans. In 1970 the Chiefs won their first superbowl against the Minesota Vikings. In 1972 they moved into Arrowhead Stadium where they have played ever since. They never had much success since 1970, but in early news they have now been to 5 straight AFC Championships, 3 Superbowls, and 2 Superbowl victories. </p>
